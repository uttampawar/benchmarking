 *Extracted from **benchmarking-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

 ### nodejs/benchmarking

 * Investigate the time taken, and number of benchmarks in core [#225](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/225)
   * Currently Gabriel is working to provide some way (approach) to run micro-benchmarks. We may not be able to run all every night but we could run few most critical ones or random set of microbenchmarks.
   * There is still a question of displaying the charts for these microbenchmarks. How do we get one number or one chart? Gabriel, will open an issue with said proposal.

 * Octaviansoldea: sharing Node-DC-EISâ€™s inconsistent behavior with various version of Node.js. Octavian will open an issue to track the workload behavior and missing numbers from the ops/sec chart.
